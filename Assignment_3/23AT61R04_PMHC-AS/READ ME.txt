Project: Preferences Match using Single Linkage Agglomerative (Bottom-Up) Clustering Technique
Author: Thummalabavi Sankshay Reddy
Roll No: 23AT61R04
Project Code: PMHC-AS

---

Overview:
This project implements two clustering techniques: k-means clustering and single linkage agglomerative clustering. The main goal is to match preferences based on clustering analysis.

---

Files Included:
1. main.py - Main Python script containing the clustering algorithms and evaluation functions.
2. preferences.csv - Sample CSV file containing preference data for clustering.
3. README.txt - This file providing an overview of the project and instructions.

---

Setup:
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install required libraries using the command: pip install pandas numpy

---

Usage:
1. Place the 'preferences.csv' file in the same directory as the 'main.py' script.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using the command: python main.py
4. The script will perform k-means clustering for different values of k and select the optimal k based on the silhouette coefficient.
5. It will then perform hierarchical clustering using the selected k and output the final clusters for both k-means and hierarchical clustering.
6. The results will be saved to 'kmeans.txt' and 'agglomerative.txt' respectively.

---

Note:
- Ensure that the 'preferences.csv' file is correctly formatted with preference data.
- The script uses cosine similarity for distance calculations in clustering algorithms.
- You can modify the script or input data as per your requirements.
